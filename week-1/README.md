Day-3 SQL JOINS
# SQL JOIN Operations Assignment

## Overview
This project contains SQL queries demonstrating different types of JOIN operations using a Student Management Database.

The assignment covers:

- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN
- INNER relationship handling
- Finding unmatched records
- Generating combined reports from multiple tables

---

## Tables Used

### Students
Contains student details.

### Courses
Contains course information.

### Enrollments
Stores student course enrollment details.

### Instructors
Contains instructor information.

---

## Topics Covered

1. Display students and their enrolled courses
2. Find courses with no enrolled students
3. Display instructors and assigned courses
4. Find courses without instructors
5. RIGHT JOIN usage
6. Find students not enrolled in any course
7. FULL OUTER JOIN implementation
8. Find courses never enrolled
9. FULL OUTER JOIN between instructors and courses
10. Generate combined student-course-instructor report

---

## Important Note

MySQL does not directly support:

```sql
FULL OUTER JOIN
```

Therefore, FULL OUTER JOIN operations were implemented using:

```sql
LEFT JOIN
UNION
RIGHT JOIN
```

---

## Technologies Used

- MySQL
- SQL JOIN Operations

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, the following concepts were understood:

- Relationship handling between tables
- JOIN operations in SQL
- Handling NULL values
- Combining data from multiple tables
- Simulating FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL
